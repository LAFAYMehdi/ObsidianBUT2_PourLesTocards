**How to talk about somebody’s personality**
**Exercises:**

1. This is a difficult exercise, but life is though anyway, so let’s get on with it…
You have to list, in the following grid, 5 positive and 5 negative adjectives about yourself…(as far as your personality is concerned of course).
A job interview is like a game of chess, so be careful about what you are going to say….
I guess that if you say you are “dishonest” or “lazy” the interview will probably be very short ;)


| Positive Adjectives | Negative Adjectives |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
|                     |                     |

2. Let’s do the same, but this time you will describe somebody you know who is currently in your group, or was last year. We’ll try to guess who you are talking about (and we will compare your descriptions with theirs!

3. If we have the time, let’s play a little game. There are so many (too many IMHO (in my humble opinion) ;) ) superheroes in the DC and Marvel Universes, that for non-specialists, it might seem almost impossible to distinguish between them...So, let’s see how good you are at recognizing them...Choose one, describe as accurately as possible their personality and we’ll try to guess who you are talking about!
